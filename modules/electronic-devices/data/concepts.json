      "detailedDescription": "A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance). It has low resistance in one direction and high resistance in the opposite direction. Diodes are fundamental building blocks in electronic circuits and are used for rectification, voltage regulation, and signal processing.",
